# Jal Nivaran (జల్ నివారణ)
### Water-logging Management & Response System - A Telangana Government Initiative

**Jal Nivaran** is a comprehensive, real-time platform designed to monitor, report, and manage water-logging and flood situations across Telangana. This project integrates IoT sensing, citizen reporting, and robust role-based administrative controls to provide an end-to-end disaster response solution.

## ✨ Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Unified Disaster Dashboard
*   **Real-time Alerts**: Live tracking of water levels and flood warnings across different zones (e.g., Hyderabad/Musi River).
*   **Interactive Maps**: Visual representation of water-logged hotspots using IoT sensor data.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Admin Panel**: Restricted access for governmental officials (e.g., `spandanmondal15@gmail.com`) to manage the entire relief effort.
*   **Volunteer System**: Secure login for approved volunteers to view assignments and report status updates.
*   **Guest Access**: Allows citizens to "Continue as Guest" while still capturing essential contact details for tracking and safety.

### 3. Advanced Volunteer Management
*   **Approval Workflow**: Admins can review pending volunteer applications and approve/reject them. Approved volunteers are automatically granted system privileges.
*   **Task Assignment**: Direct allocation of relief tasks to available volunteers based on severity.

### 4. Citizen Reporting & Engagement
*   **Public Reporting**: Dedicated forms for citizens to report water-logging with image uploads and location tagging.
*   **Emergency Resources**: Quick access to contact numbers, shelter locations, and health resources.

### 5. IoT Integration
*   **Smart Sensing**: Simulated via Wokwi, using ESP32 and ultrasonic sensors to detect drain overflow and road conditions.
*   **Data Sync**: IoT data is piped into the main dashboard to provide predictive alerts before flooding becomes critical.

## 🏛️ Project Motivation

Urban flooding is a growing challenge in rapidly developing states like Telangana. **Jal Nivaran** bridges the gap between technology and ground-level response. By combining IoT, official administration, and community volunteerism, we aim to minimize response time and ensure citizen safety during monsoons.
